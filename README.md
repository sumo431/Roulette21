# Roulette 21
(Not Complete Yet)

Roulette 21 is a simple web-based counting game inspired by the classic "21 game".
Players take turns adding 1 to 3 numbers, and the player who reaches exactly 21 loses.
The next player is chosen randomly by a roulette-style system, so the same player may be selected multiple times in a row.
